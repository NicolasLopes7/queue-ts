# queue-ts
that repo is a tiny engine to run background jobs without any dependencies.

### TODO

- [ ] Spawn another thread with the job (make it sure that event loop won't be blocked)
- [ ] Communicate with the current job state through messages (process)
- [ ] Create Retries mechanism


if you have any other idea to that repo, feel free to open an issue and contribute :)
